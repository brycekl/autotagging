as known information
Natural	:Natural waist refers to the narrowest part of a person's waist, typically located between the bottom of the ribcage and the top of the hip bones. It is called the "natural" waist because it is the part of the waist that is most defined when a person stands upright in their natural posture.
Dropped	:A drop waist is a style of clothing design where the waistline of a garment is positioned below the natural waist, closer to the hips.
Peplum	:A peplum waist refers to a style of clothing design in which a short, flared, and often ruffled or pleated section of fabric is attached to the waistline of a dress, top, jacket, or skirt. This additional fabric extends outwards from the waist and can create a flouncy or layered effect, adding a decorative and sometimes feminine detail to the garment.
Corseted	:A corseted waist style is a fashion design that incorporates elements of a corset into a garment, typically to create a cinched and structured waistline. Corsets themselves are tight-fitting undergarments historically used to shape and support the torso, particularly the waist, and create an hourglass figure. In modern fashion, the corseted waist style draws inspiration from traditional corsets but is often incorporated into outerwear, dresses, or tops to create a fashionable and stylized look.
Wrap	:A wrap waist style is a fashion design concept that involves a garment, typically a skirt, dress, or top, that wraps around the waist and fastens by overlapping one side of the fabric with the other, often secured with ties, buttons, snaps, or hooks. This style creates a wrap-around effect, allowing the wearer to adjust the fit and secure the garment by wrapping it tightly or loosely around the waist.
